## What is Time Series analysis
 
Time series forecasting is a technique for the prediction of events through a sequence of time. The technique is used across many fields of study, from geology to behavior to economics. The techniques predict future events by analyzing the trends of the past, on the assumption that future trends will hold similar to historical trends.

Time series forecasting is performed in a variety of applications including:

- Weather forecasting
- Earthquake prediction
- Astronomy
- Statistics
- Mathematical finance
- Econometrics
- Pattern recognition
- Signal processing
- Control engineering
